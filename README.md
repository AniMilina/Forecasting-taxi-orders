# Forecasting-taxi-orders  

The Clear Taxi company has collected historical data on taxi orders at airports. To attract more drivers during peak periods, you need to predict the number of taxi orders for the next hour. We need to build a model to make such a prediction.  

The RMSE metric value on the test sample should be no more than 48.  

## Need to:  

Load the data and resample it one hour at a time.  
Analyze the data.  
Train different models with different hyperparameters. Make a test sample of 10% of the original data.  
Check the data on a test sample and draw conclusions.
